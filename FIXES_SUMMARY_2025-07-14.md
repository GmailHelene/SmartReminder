# 🔧 SmartReminder - Issues Fixed Summary (July 14, 2025)

## 📋 Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Calendar Hanging Issue
**Problem:** App was hanging when navigating to/from the calendar view
**Root Cause:** Complex calendar initialization with multiple render attempts, duplicated event listeners, and redundant authentication checks
**Solution:**
- Removed complex `initializeCalendar()` function with multiple mobile render attempts
- Simplified calendar initialization with single render attempt
- Added `window.calendarInitialized` flag to prevent multiple initializations
- Removed duplicate FullCalendar CSS/JS imports
- Streamlined event handlers to prevent conflicts

### 2. ✅ Forgot Password Functionality
**Problem:** Forgot password feature was not working properly
**Root Cause:** 
- CSRF protection was blocking API calls
- User lookup was searching by keys instead of email values
- Missing `password_reset_requests.json` file
**Solution:**
- Added `@csrf.exempt` decorator to `/forgot-password` route
- Fixed user lookup in `password_reset.py` to search by email values
- Added `password_reset_requests` to DataManager file list
- Created missing data file for password reset requests

### 3. ✅ Stylesheet Loading Error
**Problem:** Browser console showed "Failed to load stylesheet" error
**Root Cause:** Duplicate FullCalendar CSS links in dashboard.html
**Solution:**
- Removed duplicate CSS/JS imports
- Streamlined resource loading

### 4. ✅ API Endpoint Fixes
**Problem:** Some API endpoints returning errors or not working properly
**Root Cause:** Syntax errors in `app.py` and missing function implementations
**Solution:**
- Fixed syntax error in `/api/calendar-events` endpoint
- Added proper extended properties for calendar events
- Fixed shared reminders data structure
