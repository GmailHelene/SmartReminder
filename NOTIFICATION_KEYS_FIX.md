# Notification System Key Issue Resolution

## Current Status

The notification system currently experiences the "Invalid EC key" error when attempting to send real push notifications. This is likely due to compatibility issues between the VAPID key format and the pywebpush library.

## Workaround Implemented

We've implemented a mock testing mode that allows testing the notification flow without relying on the WebPush API. This approach is suitable for:

1. Development testing
2. CI/CD pipelines
3. Code validation without browser dependencies

## Using Mock Mode

To test the notification system without sending real notifications:

```bash
python3 test_comprehensive_notifications.py --mock
```

or 

```bash
python3 test_notification_fix.py --mock
```

## For Production Use

For production environments, consider the following options:

1. Use a more recent version of the pywebpush library
2. Try a different WebPush library (like web-push by NPM if using Node.js)
3. Use a third-party notification service (Firebase, OneSignal, etc.)

## Resources

- A new script (`generate_vapid_keys_direct.py`) has been created that generates keys in the correct format
- A test subscription generator (`fix_test_subscription.py`) creates properly formatted test subscriptions
- Documentation in NOTIFICATION_TESTING.md has been updated with troubleshooting information

## Next Steps

1. Test thoroughly with mock mode to validate notification flow logic
2. When ready for production, consider implementing one of the solutions mentioned above
3. Update VAPID keys with proper format once the library issue is resolved
